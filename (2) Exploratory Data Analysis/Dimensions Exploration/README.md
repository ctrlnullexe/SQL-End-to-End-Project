# 🧩 Dimensions Exploration

This folder contains queries that explore **descriptive tables** (dimensions) in the warehouse.

### Purpose
- Understand diversity and distribution of **customers and products**.  
- Check for missing values, standardization, and structure.  
- Prepare for joins with fact tables in measures or ranking analysis.

### Key Insights
- **Customers**: Primarily from US, Germany, UK, Canada, Australia, France; some missing (`N/A`).  
- **Products**: Organized into clear **categories and subcategories**. Supports aggregation and drill-down in dashboards.  
- Dimensions are clean, consistent, and ready for analytics.

### How to Use
1. Open SQL files in this folder (`dimension_overview.sql`, etc.).  
2. Run the queries against the `gold` layer.  
3. Check the comments for insights.
