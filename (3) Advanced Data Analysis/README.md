# Advanced Data Analysis Project

**From clean data to actionable business insights.**

This project builds on the Data Warehouse you created (Bronze → Silver → Gold) and focuses on **extracting business intelligence**. We move past basic exploration into **strategic analysis**, answering questions like:  
- Which products and customers drive revenue?  
- How do trends evolve over time?  
- Where should the business focus resources next?
