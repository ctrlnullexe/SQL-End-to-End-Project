# Advanced Data Analysis (Phase 3)

**Turning gold layer data into business insights.**

This part of the project goes beyond exploration. It shows how to analyze data for performance, trends, segmentation, and actionable intelligence. The goal isn’t just to run queries — it’s to **understand what drives revenue, customers, and products**.

## Structure

The folder is organized by type of advanced analysis:

Advanced Data Analysis/

├── Change Over Time/

├── Cumulative Analysis/

├── Customers Report/

├── Data Segmentation/

├── Part-to-Whole Analysis/

└── Performance & Products Report/

---

Each folder contains SQL queries and notes for that type of analysis. Some queries are short. The focus is insights and business understanding, not just query volume.

## How it works

1. **Change Over Time** → Track revenue, sales, and trends over years, months, or quarters.  
2. **Cumulative Analysis** → Running totals to understand growth trajectory for sales and quantity.  
3. **Customers Report** → Identify top customers, loyalty patterns, and revenue contributions.  
4. **Data Segmentation** → Compare performance across regions, categories, or customer types.  
5. **Part-to-Whole Analysis** → See which products or segments contribute most to total sales.  
6. **Performance & Products Report** → Rank top/bottom products, categories, and customers for insights and recommendations.
